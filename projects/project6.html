                            <p>Working with like-minded students at WPI, I co-founded a student organization called WPI Launchpad to enhance the entrepreneurial culture at WPI. As a team, we completed the <a href="http://universityinnovationfellows.org/">University Innovation Fellows</a> training program last year through Stanford's d.school Institute of Design.
                            </p>
                            <p>This past semester we restarted a WPI tradition called InterSession, in which students, faculty and alumni come together over winter break to teach and learn together. We coordinated with faculty and alumni to offer courses in everything from glassblowing to Army leadership tactics to vinyl record making to Scrum certification. This mix of courses was designed to get students excited about learning outside of the classroom, and the event was a huge success. </p>

                                <p>Our next project is a student pitch competition with accompanying courses in ideation, the business model canvas, and how to write a pitch deck. We're coordinating with a few local incubators, accelerators and advising groups to hopefully offer seed money, working space and advising to the winning groups.
