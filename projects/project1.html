                                Working with 3 other students (mechanical, robotics and electrical engineers), I created a robotic, voice-controlled spice rack at the <strong>MakeMIT 2016 Hackathon.</strong> I utilized Amazon Alexa and Node.js on AWS Lambda to parse responses and send POST requests wirelessly to Particle Photon microcontroller.

                                I also wrote firmware for the microcontroller in C to accept HTTP requests and control a gear motor with encoder. It was my first time working with the Alexa Kills Kit and AWS Lambda and I learned a ton. While the idea for the project started out as a joke, we ended up winning 3rd place out of over 60 teams, as well as a few other awards.</p>

                                Spicio allows users to simply say things like, "Alexa, pour me 1 teaspoons of cayenne and 2 teaspoons of chili powder." In the future, we want to add functionality for finding recipes and ordering ingredients by voice.

                                <p>Our team was invited back for the second weekend of hacking where we created a second prototype in 8 hours. Just one day (and about 2 hours of sleep) later, I gave a 5 minute pitch to a panel of VC's as a finalist in AlphaLab Gear's National Hardware Cup in Cambridge. It was an incredible week that further fueled my interest in hackathons and startups.</p>
