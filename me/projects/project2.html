                               While studying abroad, my group partner Isa and I created an internet of things device to increase efficiency in cafeteria checkout lines. We built a prototype of a lunch tray containing an RFID reader and a WiFi-enabled microcontroller, as well as a web app.</p>

                               <p>
                                I focused on implementing the simple webapp (front and back end) that interfaced wirelessly over HTTP with the microcontroller that Isa worked on. I wrote the app in Node.js using the Express framework and used a MongoDB database to store the product information and websockets to update the inforamtion in real-time. I used Bootstrap and Chartist.js to create a simple front end dashboard with graphs. I deployed the app to Heroku.
                               </p>
                               <p>Our system improves efficiency, safety and availability of information to customers. They can simply place the items on their lunch tray and the web app displays information about nutrition, budgeting and allergy warnings according to the user's preferences. They can try out different combinations and see the effects in real-time, allowing them to make informed decisions.

                                </p>
                                <p>This simple functionality of our prototype shows the viability of our idea. In the future, payment would be integrated into the app to allow them to simply pay with a tap, eliminating lunch lines altogether. The model could be extended by integrating product-tagging using low-cost RFID tape and networked dispensers, as well as a theft-protection gate as ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID technology matures. These extensions could eliminate the need for checkout lines and attendants all together, as customers could simply place the items on their tray and walk out.</p>
